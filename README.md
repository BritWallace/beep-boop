This Beep-Boop project will allow a user to input a number and depending on that number they will get a loaded wacky response. The number 3 will be the most important giving a response of "Won't you be my neighbor." Second in line will be the number 2 with a response of "Boop."  Lastly, the number 1 will give a "Boop" response. All other digits will be listed starting from 0 up to the number the user inputted.
